        <p align="justify">TextReview2StarRating is a service that transforms a text review to a rating in the form of [1-5] stars.</p>

        <p align="justify">In order to train our models we use the dataset provided from Yelp containing reviews for venues. We trained several Machine Learning models like <b>Naive Bayes</b> and <b>SVM</b> that lead us in <b>an accuracy of 59% at most</b>. We then tried the Neural Networks approach by training a <b>Convolutional Neural Network</b> and two <b>Recurrent Neural Networks</b>: an <b>LSTM</b> and an <b>LSTM with an attention layer</b>.</p>

        <p align="justify">The <b>CNN</b> reached to an accuracy of <b>61.5%</b>, the <b>LSTM</b> to an accuracy of <b>62.5</b> and the <b>LSTM with an attention layer</b> to an accuracy of <b>63.1%</b>. There are a lot of parameters that we can still experiment with and that they may lead us to an even better result.</p>


        <p align="justify">Additionally, on the evaluation we performed we used a <b>confusion matrix</b> whitch proved that 85% of our models mistake are neighbouring classes. In other words, our model could wrongly evaluate a 5-star text review as a 4-star one, but rarely it would have evaluated the same review as an 1-star one. And even these mistakes were happening in reviews that wasn't clear what they meant.</p>

        <p align="justify">In this page you will find a lightweight example of a small model we trained for presentation purposes. Additionally, in our project we provide a Python implementation of a RESTful API that can exploit the full potentional of our model. In the rest of the pages you can also find some data analytics we performed on the Yelp's dataset.</p>
